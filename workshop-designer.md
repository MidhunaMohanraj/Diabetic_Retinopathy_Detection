# Integrating Custom Vision with Power Apps for Diabetic Retinopathy Detection

Stage 1: Objectives
In this project, your goal is to create an application for the detection of Diabetic Retinopathy. By the end of this stage, students should be able to:

Extract meaningful and accurate insights from datasets.
Utilize the Custom Vision service to develop an image classification solution.
Customize a Power App by incorporating various controls, images, and logical operations.
Stage 2: Expected Outcomes
Upon completing this workshop, students will have the competence to construct a custom app integrated with the Custom Vision service. Additionally, a quiz is included within the presentation slides to assess learning.

Stage 3: Learning Path
The workshop is divided into the following learning phases:

Building a Custom Vision project.
Testing the model and generating a Custom Vision link.
Connecting the Custom Vision model to the Power App.
Designing the layout of the Power App.
Evaluating the app's accuracy with new inputs.
